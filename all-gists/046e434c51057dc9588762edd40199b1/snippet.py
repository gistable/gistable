''''Fix 802.1x When Using Config Profiles and PEAP-MSCHAPV2 or EAP-TLS'''
# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #
#
# This script will find the system profile that is attached to one ethernet
# interface from our configuration profile and then copy it to all other
# ethernet interfaces so that other ethernet interfaces can be used instead
# of just the FirstActiveEthernet at time of profile installation. This issue
# is still an issue as of 10.12.3

# I'd like to give a very special thanks to Mosen who was so influencial
# in making this script a reality. Thank you so much for asssting with
# this project and it is my hope that this truly solves our 802.1x issue
# on the Mac side and allows us to move forward with the project. We
# decided to switch from EAP-TLS to PEAP-MSCHAPV2 because the user
# will still need a domain bound computer which can only be done by our
# IT Staff and will need the cert from our CA. This script does work with both
# protocols though
