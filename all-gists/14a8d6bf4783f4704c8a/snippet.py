class SimpleTriggerStep(SafeTrigger, StepUtilMixin):

    '''
    I am a step which goal is to ease the writing of trigger step. A Trigger is a special buildbot
    step that received a list of Buildbot "Scheduler Names" and trigger them, which in turn will
    launch new builds.

    The main differences with the buildbot Trigger are:

    - accept empty schedulerName in the __init__ function. Use addRuntimeSchedulerNames to add
      scheduler name just before executing the trigger
    - accept scheduler name to be directly underneath the class initialization, like "description"
      and descriptionDone
    - if an empty list of trigger is given, the step will ends in "SKIPPED" statement
    - postExecute allows you to add nice status messages and logs for the user
    - preExecute allows you to perform some actions before executing the main trigger.

    It will automatically set the step status to self.description on start, and to
    self.descriptionDone on SUCCESS. You also have self.descriptionSkipped in the case of empty
    scheduler name list.

    This executes a deferred and set the result according to this returned value.
