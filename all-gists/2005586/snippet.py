    Calculates the bearing between two points.

    The formulae used is the following:

      - `pointA: The tuple representing the latitude/longitude for the
        first point. Latitude and longitude must be in decimal degrees
      - `pointB: The tuple representing the latitude/longitude for the
        second point. Latitude and longitude must be in decimal degrees

    :Returns:
      The bearing in degrees
