This is a pure Python implementation of the K-Means Clustering algorithmn. The
original can be found here:
http://pandoricweb.tumblr.com/post/8646701677/python-implementation-of-the-k-means-clustering

I have refactored the code and added comments to aid in readability.
After reading through this code you should understand clearly how K-means works.
If not, feel free to email me with questions and suggestions. (iandanforth at
gmail)

This script specifically avoids using numpy or other more obscure libraries. It
is meant to be *clear* not fast.

I have also added integration with the plot.ly plotting library. So you can see
the clusters found by this algorithm. To install run:

```
pip install plotly
```

This script uses an offline plotting mode and will store and open plots locally.
To store and share plots online sign up for a plotly API key at https://plot.ly.
