"""

This code computes pi. It's not the first python
pi computation tool that I've written.  This program
is a good test of the mpi4py library, which is
essentially a python wrapper to the C MPI library.

To execute this code:

mpiexec -np NUMBER_OF_PROCESSES -f NODES_FILE python mpipypi.py

where....

NUMBER_OF_PROCESSES is the number of desired processes.
NODES_FILE is a file which records the location of your nodes.
