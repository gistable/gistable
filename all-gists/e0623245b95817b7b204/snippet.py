This script can be used to get a per-author RSS feed on iMore.com.  It will try to
cache the entries, so the last 40 entries from an author will show up, even if
they're no longer in the main feed.

To invoke, just call this script at the command line:

    python settern_rss.py
  
and the new feed should be written to settern.xml.
