sos-branch.py -- create an SOS branch on remote git repository

Oct 19th 2012, my colleagues found the wiki of a repository on GitHub is
corrupted, but they had not cloned the wiki since it was created. To make bad
worse, GitHub does not provide for wiki the same content accessing API as for
normal repository.

Yes, there is still a chance to recover all the commits before the corrupted
one, if you know how git works. When git pushes, it only sends commits which the
remote side does not have. Since the branch being created on remote side is
pointing to an existing commit there, git only sends an empty pack. So, all just
pretend that I have all these commits locally, send an empty pack, and then
fetch the created branch.

    Running this script might lead to data loss on remote git repository, use
    at your own risk.
